		Summary: "Finds the maximum speed your network can handle without dropping packets.",
		TechDesc: `The throughput test uses binary search to determine the maximum rate at which
	the DUT (Device Under Test) can forward frames without any frame loss. Starting at the
	theoretical maximum rate, the test iteratively adjusts the offered load based on whether
	frames were lost, converging on the maximum lossless rate. The result represents the
	maximum forwarding rate at which zero packet loss occurs for a given frame size.

	The test is performed for each of the standard frame sizes (64, 128, 256, 512, 1024,
	1280, 1518 bytes) to characterize performance across the full range of packet sizes.
	Binary search precision can be configured but typically converges within 0.1% accuracy.`,
		LaymanDesc: `Think of your network like a highway. This test finds out how many cars
	(data packets) can travel on it before traffic jams (packet loss) start happening.

	Here's how it works:
	1. Start by sending as much traffic as the network should handle
	2. If any packets get lost, slow down and try again
	3. If all packets arrive, speed up and try again
	4. Keep adjusting until we find the exact maximum speed with zero loss

	The result tells you the real-world capacity of your network equipment. If you're
	paying for a 1 Gbps connection, this test tells you if you're actually getting
	1 Gbps or something less.`,

	3. Have them send it back
	4. Receive the reply

	• Under 1ms: Excellent (good for video calls, gaming, trading)
	• 1-10ms: Good for most applications
	• 10-50ms: Acceptable for general use
	• Over 50ms: May cause noticeable delays

		Category: StandardRFC2544,

		Summary: "Measures how quickly the network recovers after being overloaded.",

		TechDesc: `The system recovery test measures how long a DUT takes to recover from
an overload condition. The test first overloads the DUT by transmitting at a rate
110% of the maximum throughput rate, then immediately reduces to 50% of the maximum
rate and measures the time until the DUT resumes normal forwarding.

This characterizes the DUT's ability to recover from congestion events and return
to normal operation. Long recovery times can impact application performance even
after the overload condition has passed.`,

		LaymanDesc: `After your network gets overwhelmed with too much traffic, how long
does it take to get back to normal?

Think of it like a busy restaurant:
• During a rush, orders get backed up
• When the rush ends, how quickly do things return to normal?
• Does the kitchen clear the backlog quickly, or stay chaotic?

This test:
1. Deliberately overwhelms the network
2. Then reduces traffic to normal levels
3. Measures how long until everything works smoothly again

Fast recovery (under 1 second) is good. Slow recovery means problems linger after
traffic spikes.`,

		WhenToUse: `• Mission-critical network validation
• Understanding DUT behavior after congestion
• Comparing equipment resilience
• Planning for traffic spike scenarios`,

		TechDesc: `The reset test measures the time required for a DUT to recover from
hardware or software reset events. The test establishes a forwarding baseline,
triggers a reset (power cycle, software reboot, or failover), and measures the
time until the DUT resumes forwarding at the baseline rate.

This is important for understanding service availability during planned or

• Or does it take time to "warm up"?

This matters because:
• Planned maintenance: How long will users be affected?
• Unexpected crashes: How quickly does service restore?
• Software updates: What's the real downtime?

Lower reset times mean less disruption during maintenance or failures.`,

		WhenToUse: `• Maintenance window planning

	This methodical approach ensures the service can meet commitments at all traffic
	levels, not just under specific conditions. Each step must pass defined thresholds
	before the service is considered properly configured.`,
		LaymanDesc: `When you buy an ethernet service from a carrier (like a 100 Mbps
	business internet connection), this test verifies you're getting what you paid for.

	The test checks your connection at different levels:
	• 25% speed: Light usage - is basic connectivity working?
	• 50% speed: Medium usage - is half the promised speed reliable?
	• 75% speed: Heavy usage - still performing well?
	• 100% speed: Maximum usage - getting full promised bandwidth?

	At each level, it checks:
	• Speed: Are you getting the bandwidth you're paying for?
	• Delay: Is the connection responsive?

This test runs your connection at full speed for an extended time to catch:
• Equipment that overheats and slows down
• Intermittent problems that come and go
• Issues that only appear under sustained load
• Time-of-day performance variations

A 15-minute test is typical for activation; longer tests (hours) are used for

can forward frames from multiple input ports to multiple output ports. Unlike RFC 2544
throughput which tests a single flow, this test exercises the switch fabric with
multiple concurrent flows to characterize aggregate forwarding capacity.

The test typically uses a full mesh pattern where each port sends to every other port,
stressing the switch's backplane and forwarding ASIC capabilities.`,

addresses a switch can store in its forwarding table while maintaining forwarding
performance. The test progressively increases the number of source MAC addresses
until the switch can no longer learn new addresses or forwarding performance degrades.

This is critical for large networks where switches must track many connected devices.`,

		LaymanDesc: `Every device on a network has a unique address (MAC address). A switch

This test answers:

populate its MAC address table with new entries. This is tested by sending frames
with new source MAC addresses at increasing rates and determining the maximum

In dynamic environments like:
• WiFi networks where people come and go
• Virtual machines spinning up and down

• Brief connectivity issues for new devices
• Traffic flooding while the switch figures things out
• Potential security implications

Faster learning = smoother experience for users joining the network.`,

switch's queuing and dropping behavior, buffer management, and fairness across
input ports during congestion.

This reveals how the switch allocates resources when demand exceeds capacity.`,
