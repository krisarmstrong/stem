// SSE (server-sent events) broadcaster. Publishers call Publish() with a
// typed frame; every connected subscriber gets a copy via its channel.
//
// Slow subscribers are dropped (their channel is closed) rather than back-
// pressuring publishers — this keeps the broadcaster non-blocking from the
// publisher side, which matters because the mode-switch path runs under
// the request handler's goroutine and must not stall.
//
// Frame types are listed in the comment on Publish.

// SSEFrame is the wire form of an event frame. The `type` field is the
// discriminator the UI consumes; `payload` is the per-type body.
//
// Reflector stats and test progress frames replicate the structure of
// the matching REST responses so the consumer can drop the same
// rendering code into either source.
