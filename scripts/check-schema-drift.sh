# caught at PR time instead of after merge.
#
# Mirrors the gate documented in krisarmstrong/niac-go ADR 0001
# (docs/adr/0001-schema-generation-from-go-structs.md) and the
# equivalent script in krisarmstrong/seed.

# Run locally with: ./scripts/check-schema-drift.sh
# CI uses the same invocation.
